# Spam Email Classification Using NLP and Machine Learning

## Overview
This project is designed to classify emails as spam or legitimate using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. The system preprocesses email data, extracts features using TF-IDF, and trains machine learning models for accurate classification.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning, tokenization, and stopword removal.
- **Feature Extraction**: Using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) to transform text data into numerical format.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Includes Logistic Regression, Na√Øve Bayes, and Support Vector Machines for classification.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for performance evaluation.

## Usage
Upload email text or a dataset for classification.
Run the application and view the prediction results (spam or legitimate) in the terminal or web interface.
